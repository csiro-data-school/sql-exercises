- "Write an R or Python function, interacting with database"
---

Write an R or Python function that queries your database.  
The function should:

#### 1. Accept a search term as an input argument.
#### 2. Search the 'annotation' column of the AlignAnnot table for any records that include the search term.
#### 3. For each match, print:
####    - The corresponding sequence's name
####    - The corresponding sequence's sample name
####    - The corresponding sequence's group name
####    - The corresponding sequence's type name
####    - The matched annotation's name
####    - The matched annotation
  
Test out your function. For example, you might call it with “hypothetical” as the search
term, as per question 12 of the previous exercise.
