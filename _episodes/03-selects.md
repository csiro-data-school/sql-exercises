Try to answer each of the following by writing a single SELECT statement per question.  
  
#### 1.	Can you list all details about all samples?  

#### 2.	Can you list just the name and species for all samples?  

#### 3.	Can you list details of the first 10 sequences?  

#### 4.	How many loaded sequences are there?  

#### 5.	How many sequences are of the type “genomeAssembly”?  

#### 6.	How many loaded sequences are there of each different type?  

#### 7.	How many sequences have a length greater than 1000?  

#### 8.	How many sequences have a length greater than 1000 and are from sample “D36-s2-tr”?  

#### 9.	What is the average length of all sequences?  

#### 10.	What is the average length of sequences of type “genomeAssembly”?  

#### 11.	What is the average length of sequences of type “genomeAssembly” AND what is the average length of sequences of type “protein”?  

#### 12.	How many annotations (alignedannot.annotation) contain the phrase “hypothetical”?  

#### 13.	Can you list details of the sequence named “D18-gDNA-s1638”, replacing the foreign keys with sensible info (e.g. replace ‘isSample’ id with actual sample name)?  

#### 14.	Does the sequence named “D18-gDNA-s1638” have any other sequences that align onto it (it’ll appear in seqRelation.parentSeq)?  List the name(s) of any such sequence(s).  
Hint for Q14: You’ll need to make use of the [‘AS’ keyword](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alias.asp)
